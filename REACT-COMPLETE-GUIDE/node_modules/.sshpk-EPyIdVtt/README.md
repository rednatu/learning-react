sshpk
=========

Parse, convert, fingerprint and use SSH keys (both public and private) in pure
node -- no `ssh-keygen` or other external dependencies.

Supports RSA, DSA, ECDSA (nistp-\*) and ED25519 key types, in PEM (PKCS#1, 
PKCS#8) and OpenSSH formats.

This library has been extracted from
[`node-http-signature`](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature)
(work by [Mark Cavage](https://github.com/mcavage) and
[Dave Eddy](https://github.com/bahamas10)) and
[`node-ssh-fingerprint`](https://github.com/bahamas10/node-ssh-fingerprint)
(work by Dave Eddy), with additions (including ECDSA support) by
[Alex Wilson](https://github.com/arekinath).

Install
