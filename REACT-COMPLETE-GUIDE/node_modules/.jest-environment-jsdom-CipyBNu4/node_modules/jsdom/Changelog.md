## 11.12.0

* Added `window.localStorage`, `window.sessionStorage`, and `StorageEvent` support. These are currently only stored in-memory; file an issue if you need persistent (on-disk) storage capability so we can discuss adding that. This feature includes the new `storageQuota` option for controlling how much can be stored.
* Added `element.closest()`. (caub)
* Changed `"hashchange"` and `"popstate"` events to no longer bubble, per a specification update.
* Fixed the old API in Node.js v10 to not throw, when given input that is not a valid file path (such as a typical HTML string).
* Upgraded `cssstyle` to v1.0.0, bringing along various fixes to our CSS parser and object model. (eddies)
* Upgraded `nwsapi` to v2.0.7, bringing along various fixes to our selector engine.

## 11.11.0

* Added `node.getRootNode()`. (FrecksterGIT)
* Added `label.control`. (FrecksterGIT)
* Added `el.labels` for form control elements. (FrecksterGIT)
* Fixed the `contentType` of `Document`s created through `<iframe>`s.
* Fixed the `contentType` and `origin` of `Document`s created through `document.implementation.createDocument()`.
* Fixed `sourceEl.srcset` to return the value of the `srcset=""` attribute, instead of the `cite=""` attribute.
* Fixed `node.normalize()` to not modify non-`Text` nodes. (lddubeau)
* Upgraded `cssstyle` to v0.3.1, bringing along various fixes to our CSS parser and object model. (jsakas)
* Upgraded `whatwg-url` to v6.4.1, fixing the interaction of `URL`'s `href` and `searchParams` properties.
* Upgraded our selector matching engine from `nwsmatcher` to `nwsapi`, bringing along extensive fixes, performance improvements, and additional selector support.

## 11.10.0

* Added `event.srcElement` and `event.returnValue`.
* Fixed `XMLHttpRequest` to correctly set the User-Agent header, and set it on CORS preflight requests. (BehindTheMath)

## 11.9.0

* Added `node.lookupPrefix()`, `node.lookupNamespaceURI()` and `node.isDefaultNamespace()`.
* Fixed the cloning of `Document`s; previously it would not clone all of the appropriate state, and would sometimes add an extra document type node.
* Fixed various edge cases in the `textContent` and `nodeValue` properties.
* Fixed `canvas.toBlob()` to properly pass through the JPEG quality argument, instead of always passing zero to `node-canvas`. (challakoushik)

## 11.8.0

* Added the full constraint validation API, i.e. `willValidate`, `validity`, `validationMessage`, `checkValidity()`, `reportValidity()`, and `setCustomValidity()`, on `HTMLButtonElement`, `HTMLFieldSetElement`, `HTMLFormElement`, `HTMLInputElement`, `HTMLObjectElement`, `HTMLOutputElement`, `HTMLSelectElement`, and `HTMLTextAreaElement`. (kontomondo)
* Added `getElementById()` to `DocumentFragment`.

## 11.7.0

* Added the boolean return value to `DOMTokenList`'s `replace()` method, per the recent spec addition.
* Added `FileReader`'s `readAsBinaryString()` method, as it has been added back to the specification.
* Fixed event handlers to be own properties of each `Window`, instead of on `Window.prototype`. (Fetz)
* Fixed an exception that would sometimes get raised when removing an `<img>` element's `src=""` attribute. (atsikov)
* Fixed `"abort"` events on `AbortSignal`s to have their `isTrusted` set to true.
* Fixed some argument conversions in `XMLHttpRequest`'s `open()` method.
* Improved MIME type and data: URL parsing throughout jsdom, by using the new [`whatwg-mimetype`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatwg-mimetype) and [`data-urls`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-urls) packages.
* Removed some unnecessary `.webidl` files that were included in the npm package.

## 11.6.2

* Fixed another regression (since v11.6.0) in `<style>` elements, where they would omit a series of parsing `"jsdomError"`s for any style sheet text containing spaces.
* Generally improved the spec-conformance of when `<style>` and `<script>` elements are evaluated; for example, `<script>` elements inserted by `innerHTML` are no longer evaluated.

## 11.6.1

* Fixed one regression (since v11.6.0) in `<style>` elements, where their `sheet` property would sometimes be `null` when it should not be.
* Fixed a case where a `<style>` element's `sheet` property would be left as a `CSSStyleSheet` despite it not being in the document.

Another regression remains where we are emitting spurious CSS-parsing `"jsdomError"` events; see [#2123](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/2123). We also discovered a large amount of preexisting brokenness around `<style>`, `<link>`, and `@import`; see [#2124](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/2124) for more details.

We'll try to fix these soon, especially the regression.

## 11.6.0

* Added a fully-functioning `WebSocket` implementation!
* Added a `window.performance` implementation, including the basics of the [High Resolution Time](https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/) specification: `performance.now()`, `performance.timeOrigin`, and `performance.toJSON()`.
* Added support for all of the public API of `HTMLMeterElement`, except for `meterEl.labels`.
* Added the `locationbar`, `menubar`, `personalbar`, `scrollbars`, `statusbar`, and `toolbar` properties to `Window`.
* Added more properties to `window.screen`: `availWidth`, `availHeight`, `colorDepth`, and `pixelDepth`. All of its properties are now getters as well.
* Added `window.devicePixelRatio`.
* Added `getModifierState()` to `MouseEvent` and `KeyboardEvent`.
* Added a setter for `HTMLInputElement`'s `files` property.
* Added support for the `endings` option to the `Blob` constructor.
* Fixed firing various event firings to have the correct default values, e.g. the properties of `MouseEvent` when using `element.click()`.
* Fixed the firing of `popstate` and `hashchange` events during fragment navigation to make them trusted events.
* Fixed `data:` URL parsing to not include the fragment portions.
* Fixed all URL-accepting properties to properly perform [scalar value string conversion](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#javascript-string-convert) and URL resolution.
* Fixed many other small edge-case conformance issues in the API surface of various web APIs; see [#2053](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/pull/2053) and [#2081](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/pull/2081) for more information.
* Fixed various APIs to use ASCII lowercasing, instead of Unicode lowercasing, for element and attribute names.
* Fixed the encoding of a document created via `new Document()` to be UTF-8.
* Fixed event handler properties behavior when given non-callable objects.
* Increased the performance of parsing HTML documents with large numbers of sibling elements.
* Removed `probablySupportsContext()` and `setContext()` from `HTMLCanvasElement`, per spec updates.
* Removed the nonstandard `window.scrollLeft` and `window.scrollTop` properties, and the `window.createPopup()` method.

## 11.5.1

(This should have been a minor release; oops.)

* Added `AbortSignal` and `AbortController`.
* Fixed validation for file `<input>`s and implemented validation for more input types.

## 11.4.0

For this release we'd like to welcome [@Zirro](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/commits?author=Zirro) to the core team; his contributions over the course of this year have enhanced jsdom immensely.

* Added a rudimentary set of SVG element classes, namely `SVGElement`, `SVGGraphicsElement`, `SVGSVGElement`, `SVGTests`, `SVGAnimatedString`, `SVGNumber`, and `SVGStringList`. The main impact here is that SVG elements are now instances of `SVGElement`, instead of being simply `Element` (as they were in v11.3.0) or `HTMLUnknownElement` (as they were in v11.2.0 and previously). The only concrete subclass that is implemented is `SVGSVGElement`, for `<svg>` itself; other tags will not map to their correct classes, because those classes are not yet implemented.
* Added the new `pretendTo
